## üìù Abstract
### üëì Summary
A TLDR summary of the findings of the project. 

Answers to the question: What is the best neighborhood? And How did you determine that answer (brief summary of metrics)

### üß™ Formula
![rank formula](formula.png)

Each data point was divided by the maximum value in its respective dataset, then multiplied by its weight. _Negative_ factors such as crime rate subtract from the rank. These scores were added together to find the final neighborhood score.
