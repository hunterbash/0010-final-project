## üìù Abstract
A TLDR summary of the findings of the project. 

Answers to the question: What is the best neighborhood? And How did you determine that answer (brief summary of metrics)

Formula for the determining best/worst neighborhoods = (value / max value in the set) * Weight based on the importance of the factor
Additionaly if the value is a negative factor such as crime rate in the are we multipy it by (-1), so we can just add all points per neighborhood.
